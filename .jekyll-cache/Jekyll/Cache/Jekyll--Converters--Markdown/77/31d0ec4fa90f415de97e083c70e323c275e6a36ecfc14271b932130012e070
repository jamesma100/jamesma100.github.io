I"R<p>In the past I studied computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was part of Professor <a href="https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/mse/faculty/morgan_dane">Dane Morgan</a>â€™s research group building supervised learning models for molecular data. I also worked with Dr. <a href="https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/people-search/people/staff/6357/Raza_Farhan">Farhan Raza</a> on his research in heart failure, mostly writing R code for statistical inference &amp; visualization.</p>

<p>I am interested in all parts of a distributed system that can handle large workloads without sacrificing safety or correctness, from low-level transactional guarantees to high-level consensus protocols. I like to <a href="/">blog</a> about things I find interesting. You can also find me on <a href="https://github.com/jamesma100">Github</a>!</p>
