In the past I studied computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was part of Prof. [Dane Morgan](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/mse/faculty/morgan_dane)'s research group working on ML for molecular data. I also worked with Dr. [Farhan Raza](https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/people-search/people/staff/6357/Raza_Farhan) on statistical analysis of heart failure and co-authored a [paper](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.123.010826) in the American Heart Association.

I'm currently a software engineer at [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/), building tools for large-scale geospatial data. I enjoy writing and using software that is performant, secure, simple, open-source, and bloat-free. I do use a [GitHub](https://github.com/jamesma100), though I may be moving off of it soon (see my previous point).

My preferred contact method is email, which is jamesma100 [at] gmail [dot] com. You can find my GPG key [here](/assets/files/mygpg.key).
