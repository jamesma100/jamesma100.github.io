In the past I studied computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was part of Prof. [Dane Morgan](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/mse/faculty/morgan_dane)'s research group building supervised learning algorithms for molecular data. I also worked with Dr. [Farhan Raza](https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/people-search/people/staff/6357/Raza_Farhan) on a research study in heart failure, mostly writing R code for statistical analysis and visualisation. Our [paper](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.123.010826) was recently accepted to the AHA.

I'm currently a software engineer at [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/), building tools for large-scale geospatial data.

Outside of work I like reading, cooking, and spending time outdoors hiking, biking, and running. I've also played the piano since five, mostly for fun nowadays.
