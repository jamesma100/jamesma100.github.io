In the past I studied computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was part of Professor [Dane Morgan](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/mse/faculty/morgan_dane)'s research group building supervised learning models for molecular data. I also worked with Dr. [Farhan Raza](https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/people-search/people/staff/6357/Raza_Farhan) on his research in heart failure, mostly writing R code for statistical inference & visualization.

I'm currently a software engineer at [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/), where we build tools for large-scale geospatial data (think, the datasets that goes into Apple Maps and Uber).

Outside of work I like reading, cooking, and spending time outdoors hiking, biking, and running (currently training for my first half-marathon!).
I've also played the piano since five, mostly for fun nowadays.
