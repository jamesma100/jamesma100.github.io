In the past I studied computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was part of Professor [Dane Morgan](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/mse/faculty/morgan_dane)'s research group building supervised learning models for molecular data. I also worked with Dr. [Farhan Raza](https://www.medicine.wisc.edu/people-search/people/staff/6357/Raza_Farhan) on his research in heart failure, mostly writing R code for statistical inference & visualization.

These days my interests broadly include developer tools, operating systems, databases, and distributed systems. I like to [blog](/) about things I find interesting. You can also find me on [Github](https://github.com/jamesma100).
